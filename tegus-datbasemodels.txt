I am  building an education app, taht will create personalised lessons. We will use AI tools to generate a lesson based on the learner subject defined.
I would like to create a structure, that can consist of multiple topics and each topic will have multiple subtasks.
A subtask could be descriptive or could be explaining something or knoladge validation with exercises. 
The list of subtasks and topics can be extended during the lesson. 
I would like to provide progress report while learning.
I will use fastapi as backend, please propose database models for this task.

Write the output to models.py file

Lesson
  |-- lesson part 1
    |-- exercise 1 (Some kind of exercise/explenation)
    |-- exercise 2
       |-- lesson subtask (This part is optional and may not be present under all exercises. there may be multiple of these)
    |-- exercise 3
    |-- exercise 4
  |-- lesson part 2
  ...


All of the lessons are unique and can not be shared between other sturdents, they may be copied for a starting point. we will assume all of the lessons are personalised.
Lessons, lesson parts exercises and subtasks may be extended. this extention will happen only at the request of the student. oterwise the lesson follows the original flow.



-----------------------


Based on the models in models.py please generate the new fastapi endpoints for the added database models. use the existing style and dependencies as in the other fataspi endpoints.
split the endpoints with reasonable semantics 

----------------------

create fake data generator for the personalized learning lesson, subtasks and exercises.
